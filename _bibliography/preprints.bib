	  abstract = {Triple Differences (DDD) designs are widely used in empirical work to relax parallel trends assumptions in
     Difference-in-Differences (DiD) settings. This paper highlights that common DDD implementations---such as taking the difference
      between two DiDs or applying three-way fixed effects regressions---are generally invalid when identification requires conditioning
       on covariates. In staggered adoption settings, the common DiD practice of pooling all not-yet-treated units as a comparison group 
       can introduce additional bias, even when covariates are not required for identification. These insights challenge conventional 
       empirical strategies and underscore the need for estimators tailored specifically to DDD structures. We develop regression adjustment, 
       inverse probability weighting, and doubly robust estimators that remain valid under covariate-adjusted DDD parallel trends. For staggered 
       designs, we demonstrate how to effectively utilize multiple comparison groups to obtain more informative inferences. Simulations and three 
       empirical applications highlight bias reductions and precision gains relative to standard approaches, offering a new framework for DDD 
       estimation in empirical research. A companion R package is available.},
