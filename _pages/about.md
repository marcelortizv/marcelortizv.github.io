I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate in Economics at [Emory University](https://economics.emory.edu/people/doctoral-students/ortiz-marcelo.html){:target="_blank"}. I hold a B.A. and M.Sc. in Economics from [ESPOL](https://www.espol.edu.ec/){:target="_blank"}.

Before starting my doctorate, I worked in the tech sector as Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer, and served as a Research Consultant for the [Inter-American Development Bank](https://www.iadb.org/en){:target="_blank"}.

My research focuses on applied and theoretical econometrics, with an emphasis on causal inference, statistical learning, and semiparametric efficiency theory. I am interested in developing rigorous methods to address policy-relevant questions in applied microeconomics.
