I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Economics at [Emory University](https://economics.emory.edu/people/grad-students/ortiz-marcelo.html). I hold a B.A. and M.Sc. in Economics from [ESPOL](https://www.espol.edu.ec/).

Prior to joining Emory, I gained experience as Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer in the tech industry and, also worked as Research Consultant at the [Inter-American Development Bank](https://www.iadb.org/en).

My research interests lie in the fields of Econometrics, Causal Inference, Machine Learning, and Applied Microeconomics.
